            <div class="question">Could you tell me about yourself?</div>
            <div class="answer"> “I come from a small town, where opportunities were limited. Since good schools were a
                rarity, I started using online learning to stay up to date with the best. That’s where I learned to code
                and then I went on to get my certification as a computer programmer. After I got my first job as a
                front-end coder, I continued to invest time in mastering both front- and back-end languages, tools, and
                frameworks.”</div>

            <div class="question">How did you hear about this position?</div>
            <div class="answer">“I learned about the position through LinkedIn as I’ve been following your company’s
                page for a while now. I’m really passionate about the work you’re doing in X, Y, and Z areas, so I
                was excited to apply. The required skills match well with the skills I have, and it seems like a
                great opportunity for me to contribute to your mission, as well as a great next move for my career.”

            <div class="question">What type of work environment do you prefer?</div>
            <div class="answer">“That sounds great to me. I like fast-paced work environments because they make
                me feel like I’m always learning and growing, but I really thrive when I’m collaborating with
                team members and helping people reach a collective goal as opposed to competing. My last
                internship was at an organization with a similar culture, and I really enjoyed that balance.”
